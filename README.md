Environment : Android API 25 +

Discriptions :
- This project had implemented when I worked in Hanyang Digitech.
- A main function is to control a specific threadmil start, stop, speed up/down, incline up/down by monitoring a user's heart rate.
- Receive a user's heart rate from a wearable device, which is developed by Hanyang Digitech.
- This application connects to a wearable device by bluetooth low energy (BLE) and to a threadmil by UART (USB).
- This contains 2 types of exercise programs: one-mile, and custom.
- These programs cannot open because I don't have their copyright ^^;.
- All exercise monitors heart rate and controls speed, incline autmatically every 10 seconds.

Thank you.
